----------------------------   

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a small program to convert all files in the current directory to lower case. This is usefull when
uploading something to a unix (web) server.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- yum libc gcc

COMPILE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------
- yum install git gcc make libc-devel binutils watcom-wrc watcom-wlink-hll

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version of this sample was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. 

1) Remember to have correct header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit. Check your config.sys for "SET INCLUDE=C:\usr\include"

2) Since it uses the Watcom Resource Compiler (open source) instead of the classic rc.exe, and the the Watcom Linker, intead of the classic ilink.exe, add to your config.sys...
 SET EMXOMFLD_LINKER=wl.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_TYPE=WLINK
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC_TYPE=WRC
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC=wrc.exe

3) Run "make" or "make 2>&1 |tee make.out" to get the log file.


TOOLS USED
----------
- ArcaOS	- Verion 5.0.7
- wrc 		- Version 2.0beta1
- gcc		- gcc (GCC) 9.2.0 20190812 (OS/2 RPM build 9.2.0-5.oc00)
- make 		- Version 3.81 k2 (2017-11-10)

TROUBLESHOOT
------------
The compile produce will run by just executing make on the directory, but a compile.cmd file is includes to store the log in a file. If you want to save the log file you can run it as "nmake 2>&1 |tee make.out". The log will be saved into the "make.out" file.
 

HISTORY:
-----------------
- 1.1 - 2023-06-29
Compiled with gcc 9 under ArcaOS 5.0.7

- 1.0-r4 - 2021-02-14
Drag & drop support (new argument: directory or file name)

- 1.0-r3 - 2021-02-10
Restored OS/2-compatibility. But still broken, because the same
modified file(name) can be processed twice. Modified universal,
renamed MAKEFILE with lxLite for NMAKE, OS/2 icon added, a new
clear warning if directory is empty, formatted output, improved
error messages, exception handling, no embedded debug code, the
last file shouldn't be displayed more than once, int's replaced
by portable size_t's, unused lines and/or C++ comments removed,
processing modified, and recompiled with IBM VAC++ v3.08.

- 1.0-r2 - 2021-02-10
Still broken, though: processing of same file name twice

- 1.0 - 1997-09-21 First version
